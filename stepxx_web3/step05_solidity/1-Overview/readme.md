# Solidity Overview

Solidity is a contract-oriented programming language that is used to write smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. Here is an overview of Solidity:

## 1. Contract-Oriented

Solidity is contract-oriented, which means that it is designed to write smart contracts that are executed on the Ethereum blockchain. A smart contract is a self-executing contract that contains the terms of an agreement between two parties, written in code.

## 2. Object-Oriented

Solidity is also object-oriented, which means that it supports the concepts of classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism. This allows developers to write modular and reusable code.

## 3. Static Typing

Solidity is a statically typed language, which means that the type of a variable must be declared at compile-time. This helps to catch errors early in the development process and make the code more reliable.

## 4. Turing Complete

Solidity is a Turing-complete language, which means that it can be used to write any program that can be executed on a computer. This makes it possible to write complex smart contracts that can perform a wide range of tasks.

## 5. Gas

Gas is a unit of measurement that is used to measure the cost of executing a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain. Solidity has built-in mechanisms for managing gas usage, which helps to ensure that smart contracts are efficient and cost-effective.

## 6. Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)

The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is a virtual machine that is used to execute smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. Solidity is compiled into bytecode that can be executed by the EVM.

## 7. Web3

Web3 is a JavaScript library that is used to interact with the Ethereum blockchain. Solidity can be used in conjunction with Web3 to write web applications that interact with smart contracts.

This is a high-level overview of Solidity. Solidity is a powerful language that is essential for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.
