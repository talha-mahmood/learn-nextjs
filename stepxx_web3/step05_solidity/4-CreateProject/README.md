You need to install these dependencies to run the sample project:

**npm install --save-dev "hardhat@^2.14.0" "@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox@^2.0.0"**

If you get the following error:

**npm ERR! code ERR_SOCKET_TIMEOUT**

write the following commands:

**npm config rm proxy**

**npm config rm https-proxy**

Select to create a basic project from the menu

**npm install --save-dev @nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle ethereum-waffle chai @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers ethers**

**npx hardhat compile**

**npx hardhat test**

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

You can run it using npx hardhat run:

**$ npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts**

Lock with 1 ETH deployed to: 0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3

Connecting a wallet or Dapp to Hardhat Network

To run Hardhat Network in this way, run npx hardhat node:

**$ npx hardhat node**

Started HTTP and WebSocket JSON-RPC server at http://127.0.0.1:8545/

This will expose a JSON-RPC interface to Hardhat Network. To use it, connect your wallet or application to http://127.0.0.1:8545.

If you want to connect Hardhat to this node, for example, to run a deployment script against it, you simply need to run it using --network localhost.

To try this, start a node with npx hardhat node and re-run the deployment script using the network option:

**npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network localhost**

Congrats! You have created a project and compiled, tested, and deployed a smart contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

**npx hardhat accounts**

**npx hardhat compile**

**npx hardhat clean**

**npx hardhat test**

**npx hardhat node**

**node scripts/sample-script.js**

**npx hardhat help**
