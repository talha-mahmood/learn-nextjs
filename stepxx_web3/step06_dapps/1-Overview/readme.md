# Overview of DApps

A decentralized application, also known as a DApp, is a computer application that operates on a blockchain network. Unlike traditional applications, DApps are designed to be decentralized and trustless, meaning they don't require intermediaries to operate.

DApps are built using smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code. These smart contracts are executed on a blockchain network, which is a decentralized, distributed ledger that records and stores transactional data. 

DApps can be designed to perform a wide range of functions, from financial transactions to gaming to social networking. Some of the popular examples of DApps include:

1. Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum
2. Decentralized exchanges such as Uniswap and Sushiswap
3. Gaming platforms such as Axie Infinity and Gods Unchained
4. Prediction markets such as Augur and Gnosis
5. Social networking platforms such as Minds and Steemit

One of the primary advantages of DApps is their decentralization, which means they operate without a central authority or point of control. This makes them more secure, transparent, and resistant to censorship than traditional applications. Additionally, DApps typically operate on a peer-to-peer network, which can reduce transaction fees and increase the speed of transactions. However, DApps may also face challenges such as scalability issues and regulatory uncertainty.
