# Hardhat Structure

Here is an overview of the Hardhat structure:

## 1. Node.js

Hardhat is built on top of Node.js, a JavaScript runtime that allows developers to run JavaScript outside of a web browser.

## 2. Hardhat Runtime Environment (HRE)

The Hardhat Runtime Environment (HRE) is the core of the Hardhat architecture. It is a JavaScript object that provides access to the Ethereum network and all of the tools and functionality needed for smart contract development.

## 3. Hardhat Network

Hardhat Network is a local Ethereum network that runs on your machine. It is designed to mimic the behavior of the Ethereum mainnet, but with much faster block times and the ability to mine blocks instantly. This makes it ideal for testing and development purposes.

## 4. Hardhat Plugins

Hardhat Plugins are modules that extend the functionality of the Hardhat Runtime Environment. They can be used to add new tasks, add new network types, or provide other useful features.

## 5. Hardhat Config

The Hardhat Config is a JavaScript file that defines the configuration of your Hardhat project. It can be used to specify the network settings, enable plugins, and configure other aspects of your project.

## 6. Testing Frameworks

Hardhat supports several popular testing frameworks, including Mocha and Chai, as well as its own built-in testing framework. These frameworks can be used to write automated tests for your smart contracts.

## 7. Solidity Compiler

The Solidity Compiler is a tool that compiles Solidity smart contracts into bytecode that can be executed on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Hardhat includes a built-in Solidity Compiler that can be used to compile your smart contracts.

## 8. Ethereum JSON-RPC

The Ethereum JSON-RPC is a protocol that allows developers to interact with the Ethereum network using JSON-RPC over HTTP or WebSockets. Hardhat provides a built-in JSON-RPC server that can be used to interact with the local Hardhat Network.

This is a high-level overview of the Hardhat architecture. Understanding these components is essential for developing smart contracts with Hardhat.
