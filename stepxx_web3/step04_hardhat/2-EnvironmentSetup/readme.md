# Environment Setup for Hardhat

Hardhat is built on top of Node.js, a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. As most Ethereum libraries and tools are written in JavaScript, Node.js is a popular solution for running JavaScript outside of a web browser.

To set up the environment for Hardhat, follow the steps below:

## Installing Node.js

If you already have a working Node.js >=16.0 installation, you can skip this section. Otherwise, you can download and install the latest version of Node.js from the official website.

## Upgrading your Node.js installation

If you already have a working Node.js >=16.0 installation, you can skip this section. Otherwise, you can uninstall older versions of Node.js and download and install the latest version from the official website.

## Installing Node.js package manager

You can use any package manager for working with Hardhat, but it is recommended to use npm 7 or higher. To install the latest version of npm, run the following command:

npm install -g npm@latest


## Hardhat for Visual Studio Code

If you use Visual Studio Code, the official Hardhat extension - [Solidity (Solidity and Hardhat support by the Hardhat team)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=NomicFoundation.hardhat-solidity) - adds advanced support for Solidity to VSCode.
